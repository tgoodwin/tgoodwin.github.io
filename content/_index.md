## # Information

I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [LSD lab](https://lsd.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz where I am generously supported by the NSF CSGrad4US fellowship. I'm broadly interested in distributed systems and the abstractions we use to build them. Lately, I've been focusing on cloud-native programming models and the challenges they present to developers.

I lead a small engineering team at [Impossible Effort](https://impossible-effort.com), where we are currently building a new social tool for organizing and archiving community events. I also record and produce music as [Nuns Honey](https://nunshoney.bandcamp.com) - have a listen!

Tim Goodwin, David Morrison.\

## # Projects
- [kompile](https://github.com/acrlabs/kompile) (Fall 2024)\
A Go compiler targeting Kubernetes applications. It transforms a monolithic app into a microservice architecture by extracting subroutines into microservices that are called over HTTP. Presented at KubeCon North America '24.

- [obsidian-jot](https://github.com/tgoodwin/obsidian-jot) (Dec 2023)\
A macOS menu-bar app that allows you to append a quick thought to an Obsidian daily note via a global hotkey. _Helps you avoid even the slightest context switch so you can persist a thought into your note system almost as quickly as you can think it._ I needed this so I made it!

- [running.build](https://running.build) (Jul 2023)\
A web app to help plan and track the training blocks for the running events in your life. More of a "birds-eye view" than Strava, and makes it easy to plan runs around your weekly mileage targets.

- [crd-tweet](https://github.com/tgoodwin/crd-tweet) (Mar 2023)\
A fully peer-to-peer twitter prototype built with CRDTs that seeks to explore what an entirely decentralized, local-first social media platform may look like.
