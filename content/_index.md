## Information
This site features a selection of projects and experiments that I’ve worked on recently.

_About myself_ – I am a first year PhD student in the [LSD lab](https://lsd.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz. I am broadly interested in distributed systems and the abstractions we use to build them. Previously, I spent a few years as a software engineer and musician in NYC.

I lead a small engineering team at [Impossible Effort](https://impossible-effort.com), where we are building a new social tool for organizing and archiving community events. I also record and produce music as [Nuns Honey](https://nunshoney.bandcamp.com) - have a listen!
