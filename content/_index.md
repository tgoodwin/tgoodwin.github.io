## # Information

I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [LSD lab](https://lsd.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz where I am generously supported by the NSF CSGrad4US fellowship. I'm broadly interested in distributed systems and the abstractions we use to build them. Lately, I've been focusing on cloud-native programming models and the challenges they present to developers.

I lead a small engineering team at [Impossible Effort](https://hpngs.com), where we are currently building a new social tool for organizing and archiving community events. I also record and produce music as [Nuns Honey](https://nunshoney.bandcamp.com) - have a listen!

## # Projects
- [Monolift](https://github.com/tgoodwin/monolift) (2025)\
Monolift is a new technique for developing and deploying distributed applications that prioritizes incremental adoption and support for legacy code. Monolift treats distribution as a compiler pass for general purpose languages, where users guide the process via lightweight comment directives. Additionally, Monolift embeds a runtime monitor to intelligently manage the compiled application's distribution in response to live performance metrics.

- [Kamera](https://github.com/tgoodwin/kamera) (2025)\
Kamera is an observability and testing framework for debugging Kubernetes controllers and the interactions between them. Targeting platform engineering use cases, Kamera quickly diagnoses issues in custom control planes by tracing causality across controller reconciliations and the environmental events that trigger them. Additionally, Kamera employs replay and simulation techniques to catch problematic controller behaviors pre-deployment.

- [terrazas](https://discrete.events/terrazas) (Jan 2025)\
A weekend experiment with graph coloring and backtracking algorithms, inspired by the work of Mexican artist Eduardo Terrazas.

- [kompile](https://github.com/acrlabs/kompile) (Fall 2024)\
A Go compiler targeting Kubernetes applications. It can automatically transform a monolithic app into a microservice architecture by extracting subroutines into microservices that are called over HTTP. Presented at KubeCon North America '24.

- [obsidian-jot](https://github.com/tgoodwin/obsidian-jot) (Dec 2023)\
A macOS menu-bar app that allows you to append a quick thought to an Obsidian daily note via a global hotkey. _Helps you avoid even the slightest context switch so you can persist a thought into your note system almost as quickly as you can think it._ I needed this so I made it!

<!--- [running.build](https://running.build) (Jul 2023)\-->
<!--A web app to help plan and track the training blocks for the running events in your life. More of a "birds-eye view" than Strava, and makes it easy to plan runs around your weekly mileage targets.-->

- [crd-tweet](https://github.com/tgoodwin/crd-tweet) (Mar 2023)\
A fully peer-to-peer twitter prototype built with CRDTs that seeks to explore what an entirely decentralized, local-first social media platform may look like.

<!--- [Happenings](https://hpngs.com) (2019 - present)\-->
<!--A social platform for organizing and archiving community events. TypeScript + express web app, as well as a React Native iOS app. -->

<!--- [WebRTC-Analyzer](https://github.com/tgoodwin/webRTC-analyzer) (Spring 2017)\-->
<!--A simple video chat server application instrumented to evaluate the performance of the WebRTC protocol under various network conditions.-->
<!---->
<!--- [The Netflix Stream](https://discrete.events/netflix-model) (May 2017)\-->
<!--Essay on the Netflix Stream as a media artifact that explores the connections between internet topology, streaming infrastructure, consumer subjectivity, and environmental consequence.-->

<!--- [Blur](https://github.com/dextercallender/blur) (Dec 2016)\-->
<!--A simple, C-like programming language for fast image manipulation and ASCII art creation.-->

<!--- [my ad net](https://my-ad-net.appspot.com/) (Aug 2016)\-->
