## # Information
This site features a selection of projects that I've enjoyed working on over the past few years.

_About Myself_ - I am a first year PhD student in the [LSD lab](https://lsd.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz. I am broadly interested in distributed systems and the abstractions we use to build them. Lately, I've been focusing on cloud-native programming models and the challenges they present to developers.

Previously, I was working as a software engineer in New York. I lead a small engineering team at [Impossible Effort](https://impossible-effort.com), where we are building a new social tool for organizing and archiving community events. I also record and produce music as [Nuns Honey](https://nunshoney.bandcamp.com) - have a listen!
