## # Information

I am a 2nd year PhD student in the [LSD lab](https://lsd.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz where I am generously supported by the NSF CSGrad4US fellowship. I am broadly interested in distributed systems and the abstractions we use to build them. Lately, I've been focusing on cloud-native programming models and the challenges they present to developers. 

I lead a small engineering team at [Impossible Effort](https://impossible-effort.com), where we are currently building a new social tool for organizing and archiving community events. I also record and produce music as [Nuns Honey](https://nunshoney.bandcamp.com) - have a listen!

## # Projects
- [obsidian-jot](https://github.com/tgoodwin/obsidian-jot) (Dec 2023)\
A macOS menu-bar app that allows you to append a quick thought to an Obsidian daily note (or some other digital notebook) via a global hotkey. _Helps you avoid even the slightest context switch between applications so you can persist a thought into your note system almost as quickly as you can think it._ I needed this so I made it!

- [running.build](https://running.build) (Jul 2023)\
A web app to help plan and track the training blocks for the running events in your life. More of a "birds-eye view" than Strava, and makes it easy to plan out future runs around your weekly mileage targets.

- [crd-tweet](https://github.com/tgoodwin/crd-tweet) (Mar 2023)\
A fully peer-to-peer twitter prototype built with CRDTs that seeks to explore what an entirely decentralized, local-first social media platform may look like.

- [Happenings](https://whatshappenings.com) (2019 - present)\
A social tool for organizing and archiving community events.

- [WebRTC-Analyzer](https://github.com/tgoodwin/webRTC-analyzer) (Spring 2017)\
A simple video chat server application instrumented to evaluate the performance of the WebRTC protocol under various network conditions.

- [The Netflix Stream](https://discrete.events/netflix-model) (May 2017)\
Essay on the Netflix Stream as a media artifact that explores the connections between internet topology, streaming infrastructure, consumer subjectivity, and environmental consequence.

- [Blur](https://github.com/dextercallender/blur) (Dec 2016)\
A simple, C-like programming language for fast image manipulation and ASCII art creation.

- [my ad net](https://my-ad-net.appspot.com/) (Aug 2016)\
A ~~live updating~~ visualization of every ad server that exchanges data with my apartment’s local area network. A reciprocal tracking of the systems that collect personal information to serve targeted advertisements. (system offline, site served statically as of 2018).

- [birdhouse](https://discrete.events/birdhouse/) (Apr 2016)\
Website for the Alpha Delta Phi society's birdhouse event that was held on April 16, 2016.

- [what are you doing](http://tgoodwin.github.io/what-are-you-doing) (Jul 2015)\
An instant message love journey involving you and someone else. Please use Chrome for best experience.

- [Went To Japan](http://tgoodwin.github.io/went-to-japan) (May 2015)\
A photo essay and JPEG encoding experiment as my final project for the [Columbia University Japan Study Tour](https://www.college.columbia.edu/news/columbia-university-japan-study-tour-announced).
